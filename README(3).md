# 🧠 Linked Logic: Line Editing & Recursive Thinking in Java

> “Simplicity is the soul of efficiency — and recursion is its secret handshake.”  
> – *A Developer Who Didn’t Give Up on Linked Lists*

## 🚀 What Is This?

This Java project is **not just another file editor**. It's a hybrid beast combining:
- A **command-line line editor** powered by a *singly linked list* 🧵,
- A **recursive multiplication** function that dares to loop without loops 🔁,
- And a **recursive summation** of a numeric series that sums with style ➕

Imagine a world where editing a text file feels like sword-fighting — each line surgically placed or removed by precision commands. That’s what you get here. Plus, you get a calculator with the soul of a philosopher — recursion all the way down.

## 🧩 Features

- 📃 Load and save `.txt` files line-by-line using a linked list
- 🧠 Insert, append, delete, and list lines by command
- ✖️ Multiply two integers using recursion only
- ➕ Sum natural numbers recursively, because why not?
- 🧠 Modular, object-oriented Java design
- 💾 File-safe and clean CLI interface

## 🧪 Commands in the Line Editor

- `I [pos]` – Insert a new line at position `pos`
- `A` – Append a new line at the end
- `D [start] [end]` – Delete lines between `start` and `end`
- `L [start] [end]` – List lines between `start` and `end`
- `E` – Exit and save changes

## 🛠 How to Run

Make sure you have Java 11+ installed.

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```

Follow the menu options and enjoy editing and recursion like a true digital samurai 🥷.

## 🧙‍♂️ Why This Project Matters

Because sometimes, to master coding, you need to go back to the basics:
- **No fancy GUI** — just logic and raw input.
- **No shortcuts** — just you, the memory heap, and the stack.
- **Recursive soul** — because loops are easy, but recursion teaches *discipline*.
